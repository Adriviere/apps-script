# Multiple Parents Script for Google Drive

Find files with multiple parents in your Google Drive.

Google has announced the availability of Shortcuts in Google Drive, [see news](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/03/shortcuts-for-google-drive.html). 
This new feature will change the way Google Drive handles files in multiple locations/with multiple parents. From now on, a file will be attached to one and only one location (folder) and you will create shortcuts in other folders or Shared Drive.

For this reason it is better to check files in your Drive in Multiple location to assign file to the good one.

What's better than Apps Script to do this job. It does it in just 25 lines.

The script generate a spreadsheet on yur Drive with all your files and numbers of parents for each.
